## Introduction
This is my version of the graphs provided as part of the Exploratory Data Analysis course.



* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]

* <b>Description</b>: There are four R files and 4 PNG files.  The 4 PNG files are charts based off of the above data.  The 4 R files are the code used to produce those charts.  These charts are for only 2 days worth of data from the original file (Feb 1 - 2, 2007).

*<b>Instructions</b>: The dataset needs to be in your working directory before attempting to run the R Files.  Once the data is found in the working file, the R files will import that data, make necessary adjustments, and will produce the charts as PNG files.
